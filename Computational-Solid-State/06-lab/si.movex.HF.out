     the Fermi energy is     6.4567 ev

!    total energy              =     -16.91228431 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.0E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =       4.73074752 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       1.14322155 Ry

     ewald contribution        =     -16.56964891 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
