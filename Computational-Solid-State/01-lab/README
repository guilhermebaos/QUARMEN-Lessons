--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

compiling and running the codes:

* use a C compiler (here $ is the shell prompt, we use the gcc GNU compiler
  and get by default an executable named "a.out"), for instance:

          $ gcc 0_pseudorandom.c -lm 

* run the executable; if needed redirect the standart output to a file,
  for instance "outfile":

          $ ./a.out > outfile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how to use "statfor":

* compile with a fortran compiler (we use the "gfortran" GNU compiler and 
  we choose "statfor.x" as the name of the executable):

          $ gfortran statfor.f -o statfor.x

* input:  a list of numbers from the stantard input


* output: 1) on the standard output: average, variance, correlation time,
             effective number of points and statistical error on the average;
          2) on file 'histo.out': a 101-bin histogram of the data;
          3) on file 'corr.out': the data autocorrelation function;
          4) on file 'blocking.out': the reblockin analysis of the data.

          the definition of all the above quantities is given in "statfor.pdf"

* to process data contained in the first column of a file "outfile" 
  redirect the standard input of the executable:
          
          $ ./statfor.x < outfile 

  if you use the keyboard to type the list of numbers, type ctrl-d after 
  the last number, otherwise the code waits for more numbers

* to process data contained in (say) the third column of a file: 

          $ awk '{print $3}' outfile | ./statfor.x

  here "awk" is a unix command that select the third column of file "outfile",
  and the pipe symbol "|" is a unix feature which takes the standard output
  of the command on the left and gives it to the standard input of the
  executable on the right

* to plot the histogram in file 'histo.out' using gnuplot:

          $ gnuplot
          gnuplot> plot 'histo.out' using 1:2 with lines

Exercises with direct sampling (more details in comments of the C codes). 
Use statfor (see above) to get data histograms, calculate averages, etc.

0) Sample uniform distributions of integer or real numbers (0_pseudorandom.c).

1) Transform uniform random numbers to sample different distributions:

   * sample integers in (1,k) with non-uniform probability (1_tower.c)

   * sample exp(-x) (2_exp.c)

   * sample (x^k)*(k+1) in (0,1) (3_pow.c)

   * sample a gaussian using the Box-Muller algorithm (4_gauss.c)

   * sample a gaussian using the central limit theorem (5_gauss.c)

2) Monte Carlo calculation of integrals:

   * calculate \int_0^1 x^gamma dx sampling pi(x)=1 for gamma=1, -0.4, -0.8;
     note the effect of infinite variance for gamma=-0.8 (6_intpow.c)

   * calculate \int_0^1 x^(-0.8)
     sampling the distribution (x^k)*(k+1) with k=-0.7; show that importance 
     sampling removes the divergence of the variance (7_intpow.c). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metropolis sampling

0) sample a gaussian with moves uniformly distributed around the current 
   position (m1.c).

1) calculate ground state properties of the harmonic oscillator;
   analyze the results (equilibration steps, average, statistical error,
   autocorrelation as a function of the size of the move) (m2.c).
